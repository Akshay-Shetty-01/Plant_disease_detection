# Plant_disease_detection
Plant Disease Detection is one of the mind-boggling issues when we talk about using Technology in Agriculture. Although researches have been done to detect whether a plant is healthy or diseased using Deep Learning and with the help of Neural Network, new techniques are still being discovered. For Fewer Data Classical Machine Learning Models areâ€¦
